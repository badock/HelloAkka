Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.\n\nJekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:\n\ndef print_hi(name)\n  puts \"Hi, #{name}\"\nend\nprint_hi('Tom')\n#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.\n\nCheck out the Jekyll docs for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll.
